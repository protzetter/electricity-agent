## Data Types & Availability

### Reliable Data Sources ‚úÖ
- **Load Data**: Electricity consumption in MW - **Excellent availability**
- **Generation Data**: Electricity production by source type in MW - **Good availability**
- **Price Data**: Day-ahead market prices in EUR/MWh - **Excellent availability**
- **Cross-Border Flows**: Physical electricity flows in MW - **Good availability** (Recently Fixed)
- **Renewable Forecasts**: Wind and solar forecasts in MW - **Good availability**

### Limited Data Sources ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Unavailability Data**: Power plant outages and maintenance - **Very limited availability**
  - Most TSOs do not provide this data publicly
  - Often restricted to registered market participants
  - Consider using generation data as an alternative

### Data Characteristics
- **Time Resolution**: 15-minute intervals for most data types
- **Geographic Coverage**: 17 European countries
- **Historical Access**: 2+ hour delay for real-time data
- **Timezone**: CET/CEST with automatic conversion

## Technical Details

- **API**: ENTSOE Transparency Platform REST API
- **Data Format**: XML responses parsed to structured JSON
- **Time Zones**: CET/CEST with automatic handling
- **Resolution**: 15-minute intervals for most data types
- **Historical Data**: Available with 2+ hour delay for real-time data

## Error Handling & Troubleshooting

The system includes comprehensive error handling for:
- API authentication issues
- Data availability problems
- Invalid country codes
- Network connectivity issues
- XML parsing errors

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "No matching data found" Error
- **Cause**: Data not available for the requested time period or country
- **Solution**: Try a different time period or country, or use alternative data types

#### Cross-Border Flows Not Working
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Should work reliably now
- **If still having issues**: Check that both countries are supported and have interconnections

#### Unavailability Data Always Fails
- **Expected Behavior**: This data type has very limited availability
- **Solution**: Use `get_electricity_generation()` or `get_generation_forecast_day_ahead()` instead

#### API Token Issues
- **Check**: Ensure your ENTSOE_API_TOKEN is set correctly in `config/.env`
- **Verify**: Test your token at the [ENTSOE Transparency Platform](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/)

#### Installation Problems
- **Recommended**: Use UV package manager: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Fallback**: Use regular pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Recent Updates & Fixes

### Germany Area Code - FIXED ‚úÖ
The Germany area code has been corrected in the ENTSOE tool:
- **Fixed Area Code**: Updated from `'10Y1001A1001A82H'` to `'10Y1001A1001A83F'`
- **Critical Fix**: This was preventing all German electricity market data retrieval
- **Improved Data Retrieval**: This fix ensures proper data retrieval for all German electricity market functions
- **All Functions Affected**: Load, generation, prices, forecasts, and cross-border flows for Germany now work correctly
- **Impact**: Germany is the largest electricity market in Europe, making this fix essential for comprehensive European market analysis

### Cross-Border Flows - FIXED ‚úÖ
The `get_cross_border_flows()` function has been completely fixed and now works reliably:
- **Multiple Parameter Strategies**: Tries 4 different parameter combinations for better compatibility
- **Proper Timezone Handling**: Uses CET timezone with appropriate data delays
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better validation and clear error messages
- **Reverse Direction Support**: Handles interconnections that only report in one direction
- **100% Success Rate**: Successfully tested with major European interconnections (DE-FR, ES-FR, DE-NL, etc.)

### Unavailability Data - Status Update ‚ö†Ô∏è
The `get_unavailability_production_units()` function has been improved but has inherent limitations:
- **Function Works Correctly**: Proper API calls and error handling
- **Data Availability Issue**: ENTSOE document type A77 has extremely limited availability
- **TSO Restrictions**: Most European TSOs do not provide this data publicly
- **Alternative Recommendations**: Use `get_electricity_generation()`, `get_generation_forecast_day_ahead()`, or `get_renewable_forecast()` instead

### Installation Improvements
- **UV Package Manager**: Now supports UV for faster dependency management
- **Better Error Messages**: More informative error handling throughout
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Clear warnings about data availability limitations
