# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The European Electricity Market Analysis Agent is a specialized AI-powered system designed to provide comprehensive analysis of European electricity markets using real-time data from the ENTSOE (European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity) Transparency Platform. The system enables users to access, analyze, and visualize electricity market data across 17 European countries, including load consumption, generation data, day-ahead prices, renewable energy forecasts, and cross-border electricity flows. The agent serves as an intelligent interface between users and complex electricity market data, providing both technical analysis capabilities and user-friendly web interfaces for market insights.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an electricity market analyst, I want to access real-time electricity load data for European countries, so that I can monitor current consumption patterns and demand trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests electricity load data for a supported country THEN the system SHALL retrieve consumption data from the ENTSOE API with timestamps and values in MW
2. WHEN requesting load data THEN the system SHALL support configurable time ranges from 1 to 168 hours back from current time
3. WHEN load data is unavailable due to publication delays THEN the system SHALL apply country-specific data delays (24-48 hours) and inform the user
4. IF a user requests data for an unsupported country THEN the system SHALL return an error message with the list of 17 supported European countries
5. WHEN load data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL provide summary statistics including average, peak, and minimum load values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a power trader, I want to access day-ahead electricity prices for European markets, so that I can make informed trading decisions and analyze price volatility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests day-ahead prices for a country THEN the system SHALL retrieve market prices from ENTSOE with timestamps and values in EUR/MWh
2. WHEN requesting price data THEN the system SHALL support configurable time ranges from 1 to 7 days back from current time
3. WHEN price data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL provide price statistics including average, maximum, minimum, and volatility measures
4. IF price data is unavailable for the requested period THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message with suggested alternative time ranges
5. WHEN price data includes multiple market areas THEN the system SHALL handle country-specific bidding zone configurations correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a renewable energy analyst, I want to access generation data and renewable forecasts, so that I can analyze the contribution of different energy sources and predict renewable output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests generation data THEN the system SHALL retrieve actual electricity production data by source type from ENTSOE
2. WHEN requesting renewable forecasts THEN the system SHALL provide wind and solar generation predictions for up to 7 days ahead
3. WHEN generation data includes multiple production types THEN the system SHALL categorize and aggregate data by renewable vs conventional sources
4. IF renewable forecast data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide alternative data sources or suggest optimal request parameters
5. WHEN forecast data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL include forecast accuracy indicators and confidence intervals where available

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a grid operator, I want to analyze cross-border electricity flows between countries, so that I can understand interconnection utilization and regional market coupling effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests cross-border flow data THEN the system SHALL retrieve physical electricity flows between specified country pairs
2. WHEN analyzing flows THEN the system SHALL support bidirectional flow analysis showing import/export patterns
3. WHEN flow data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide flow statistics including average, maximum import/export, and net flow calculations
4. IF cross-border data is unavailable for a country pair THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative country combinations with available data
5. WHEN multiple country pairs are analyzed THEN the system SHALL provide comparative analysis of regional interconnection patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a market researcher, I want to access a web-based interface for electricity market analysis, so that I can visualize data and generate reports without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the web interface THEN the system SHALL provide a Streamlit-based dashboard with country selection and analysis type options
2. WHEN data is visualized THEN the system SHALL generate interactive charts using Plotly with time-series plots and statistical overlays
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide data export capabilities in tabular format for further analysis
4. IF data loading fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN multiple analysis types are available THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation between load, generation, prices, and forecast views

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the agent to handle API authentication and error conditions gracefully, so that the system remains reliable and provides meaningful feedback to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate ENTSOE API token configuration and provide clear setup instructions if missing
2. WHEN API requests fail due to rate limits THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN XML parsing errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with request parameters for debugging
4. IF API responses indicate data unavailability THEN the system SHALL parse ENTSOE error codes and provide user-friendly explanations
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information while presenting simplified messages to end users

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to access the agent programmatically through Python functions, so that I can integrate electricity market data into my analytical workflows and models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the Python API THEN the system SHALL provide direct function access to all ENTSOE data types without requiring the conversational interface
2. WHEN functions are called THEN the system SHALL return structured data in consistent dictionary format with status indicators
3. WHEN integrating with data analysis workflows THEN the system SHALL support pandas DataFrame conversion for seamless data manipulation
4. IF function parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation messages with acceptable parameter ranges
5. WHEN multiple data requests are made THEN the system SHALL support efficient batch processing and caching where appropriate

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an electricity market participant, I want to receive comprehensive market insights and analysis, so that I can understand market trends and make strategic decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting market insights THEN the system SHALL analyze data across multiple countries and provide comparative analysis
2. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL identify key market trends, price patterns, and anomalies automatically
3. WHEN market analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations based on current market conditions
4. IF insufficient data is available for analysis THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate data limitations and suggest alternative approaches
5. WHEN insights are generated THEN the system SHALL include confidence levels and data quality indicators for transparency
